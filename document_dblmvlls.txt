About Me & Experience

You can drop this straight into your source document.

Who are you and what do you do?

I’m a freelance web designer and developer specialising in building modern, high-quality websites for businesses, organisations, and individuals. I focus mainly on websites, with a particular interest in clean design, animation, and creating engaging user experiences that feel alive and intentional rather than static or generic.

While I work across a range of platforms and technologies, a large part of my work involves WordPress websites, custom themes, and ongoing site management.

How long have you been working in web design and development?

I’ve been working professionally in web design and development since 2012.

During that time, I’ve worked both as a freelancer/contractor and as a staff member within digital and creative agencies. This means I understand how projects are handled at an agency level, as well as how to work directly with clients one-on-one.

This mix of experience allows me to bring agency-level thinking and standards to freelance projects, without the overheads or complexity that often come with large teams.

What makes your experience different from someone newer to the industry?

Having worked consistently in the industry since 2012, I’ve seen many trends, tools, and “best practices” come and go. This helps me make practical decisions rather than chasing fads.

I’ve:

Built and maintained websites over many years

Worked with legacy systems and modern stacks

Seen how sites perform long-term, not just at launch

Fixed and improved sites built by others

Worked under agency deadlines and constraints

This experience helps me avoid common mistakes and build websites that are stable, maintainable, and fit for real-world use.

Do you work alone or as part of a team?

I work primarily as an independent freelancer. However, I have experience working as part of larger teams and collaborating with designers, developers, project managers, and content teams.

If a project requires additional skills (for example, large-scale content creation, branding, or specialised integrations), I can either collaborate with others or advise on the best approach.

For most projects, clients deal directly with me, which keeps communication clear and efficient.

What types of clients do you usually work with?

I work with a wide range of clients, including:

Small and medium-sized businesses

Creative professionals

Organisations and non-profits

Agencies needing freelance support

Clients who need ongoing website management

Some clients come to me for a brand-new website, while others need help fixing, improving, or maintaining an existing one.

Where are you based and who do you work with?

I’m based in Ireland, but I work with clients both locally and internationally. Remote work has been a normal part of my workflow for many years, so location is rarely a limitation.
