About Me & Experience
Who are you and what do you do?

I’m a freelance web designer and developer specialising in building modern, high-quality websites for businesses, organisations, and individuals.

My work focuses primarily on websites, with a strong interest in clean design, animation, and creating engaging user experiences that feel intentional rather than static or generic.

While I work across a range of platforms and technologies, a large part of my work involves WordPress websites, custom themes, and ongoing site management.

How long have you been working in web design and development?

I’ve been working professionally in web design and development since 2012.

During that time, I’ve worked both as a freelancer/contractor and as a staff member within digital and creative agencies. This gives me insight into both agency-level workflows and direct client collaboration.

This mix of experience allows me to bring agency-level standards to freelance projects, without the overheads or complexity that often come with large teams.

What makes your experience different from someone newer to the industry?

Having worked consistently in the industry since 2012, I’ve seen many tools, trends, and “best practices” come and go. This helps me make practical decisions rather than chasing short-lived fads.

I’ve:

Built and maintained websites over many years

Worked with both legacy systems and modern stacks

Seen how sites perform long-term, not just at launch

Fixed and improved sites built by others

Worked under agency deadlines and constraints

This experience helps me avoid common mistakes and build websites that are stable, maintainable, and suited to real-world use.

Do you work alone or as part of a team?

I work primarily as an independent freelancer. However, I have extensive experience collaborating with designers, developers, project managers, and content teams.

If a project requires additional skills (such as branding, large-scale content creation, or specialised integrations), I can collaborate with others or advise on the best approach.

For most projects, clients deal directly with me, which keeps communication clear and efficient.

What types of clients do you work with?

I work with a wide range of clients, including:

Small and medium-sized businesses

Creative professionals

Organisations and non-profits

Agencies needing freelance support

Clients requiring ongoing website management

Some clients come to me for a brand-new website, while others need help fixing, improving, or maintaining an existing one.

Where are you based and who do you work with?

I’m based in Ireland, but I work with clients both locally and internationally. Remote collaboration has been a normal part of my workflow for many years, so location is rarely a limitation.

Skills, Platforms & Technologies
What platforms do you work with?

I work across a range of platforms depending on what best suits the project. My strongest and most long-standing experience is with WordPress.

Platforms I regularly work with include:

WordPress

Webflow

Wix

Squarespace

Some experience with Framer

AI-assisted and prompt-based builders (where appropriate)

I’m happy to advise whether a platform is suitable for a specific project, or whether an existing site should be improved rather than rebuilt.

How experienced are you with WordPress?

WordPress is one of my core areas of expertise. I’ve worked with it consistently since around 2012 across many different types of projects.

My experience includes:

Custom theme and block-based theme development

Gutenberg and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

Twig-based templating where appropriate

Custom PHP functions, shortcodes, and plugins

WordPress Multisite

Multilingual sites using WPML

Database-level fixes and updates

Performance, security, and long-term maintenance

I’m very comfortable working on both new builds and complex legacy WordPress sites.

Do you use WordPress page builders?

Yes. While I often prefer custom themes for flexibility and performance, I regularly work with builder-based sites where appropriate.

This includes:

Elementor

Kadence

WPBakery / Visual Composer

I can build new pages, clean up existing layouts, fix broken content, and advise when a builder is becoming a limitation.

Do you fix hacked or broken WordPress sites?

Yes. I regularly help with:

Cleaning hacked installations

Removing malicious code

Fixing database issues

Recovering sites after failed updates

Restoring from backups

Hardening sites to prevent future attacks

Because WordPress is widely targeted, I’m very familiar with common failure points and how to resolve them safely.

Do you write JavaScript?

Yes. I regularly use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality.

This includes:

DOM manipulation and UI behaviour

Calculators and custom logic

Timed and scroll-based animations

Node-based workflows where required

Vue.js for structured front-end behaviour

Some experience with React-based setups (including Gatsby)

Do you do animation and motion work?

Yes — animation is a key part of my work.

I regularly work with:

GSAP (GreenSock)

Swiper

Lottie and JSON-based animations

Scroll-triggered and interaction-driven animation

My focus is on animation that enhances usability and storytelling, rather than animation purely for decoration.

Can you help with servers, hosting, and technical setup?

Yes. I regularly handle:

Website migrations

DNS configuration

.htaccess rules

Cloudflare setup and optimisation

Hosting-related troubleshooting

This is especially useful for clients who don’t want to deal with technical infrastructure themselves.

Do you handle email configuration?

Yes. I can assist with:

DMARC

SPF

DKIM

General deliverability issues

This is particularly important for contact forms and transactional emails.

Do you optimise website performance?

Yes. Performance optimisation is a key part of my work.

This includes:

Caching configuration (e.g. Breeze, WP Fastest Cache)

Cloudflare optimisation

Image optimisation

Reducing unnecessary scripts

Improving load times and Core Web Vitals where possible

Do you do graphic design as well?

Yes, primarily in support of digital and web projects.

This includes:

Image resizing and compression

SVG creation and optimisation

Vector illustration (Adobe Illustrator)

Cartoon characters and custom graphics

Motion graphics and titles (After Effects)

Simple animated assets (Animaker)

How I Work & My Process
How do projects usually start?

Projects usually begin with a simple conversation via email, form, or call.

I focus on understanding:

What the business does

What the website needs to achieve

Whether the site is new or existing

Technical or platform constraints

Budget and timeline expectations

Clarity early on matters more than long documents.

Do you work with briefs or help define the project?

Both.

I’m comfortable working from detailed briefs or helping shape a project from scratch. My goal is always to avoid unnecessary work and focus on what delivers real value.

Do you offer ongoing support after launch?

Yes. Many clients continue working with me for:

Content updates

New features or pages

Performance improvements

Security updates

General advice and technical help

This can be handled ad-hoc or via a monthly arrangement.

Pricing, Budgets & Costs
How do you charge for your work?

I generally work in two ways:

Fixed-price projects for clearly defined scopes

Hourly billing for ad-hoc work, support, and open-ended tasks

What is your hourly rate?

As of 5th January 2026, my hourly rate is:

€40 per hour + VAT

This typically applies to:

Small updates or fixes

Troubleshooting and repairs

Ongoing support

Consulting and technical advice

Work where scope may evolve

If something is better suited to fixed pricing, I’ll usually suggest that instead.

Will I know the cost upfront?

Yes. I aim to be clear about expected costs before work begins. If scope changes significantly, I’ll flag it early and discuss options.

Is VAT included in your prices?

Unless stated otherwise:

Prices are quoted exclusive of VAT

VAT is added where applicable

This is always made clear in quotes and invoices.

How much does a website cost?

Websites can vary greatly in size and complexity, but typically a basic, small site might start at around €1600 or so, excluding hosting & domain. A basic e-commerce setup might be around €2500 including a small amount of data entry. For an accurate price based on your needs, get in touch!

How long does a website take to build? 

Websites can vary greatly in size and complexity, but typically a basic, small site might take 2-4 weeks, depending on how long it takes to sign off on the design
