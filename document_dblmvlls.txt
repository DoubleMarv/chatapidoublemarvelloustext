About Me & Experience

You can drop this straight into your source document.

Who are you and what do you do?

I’m a freelance web designer and developer specialising in building modern, high-quality websites for businesses, organisations, and individuals. I focus mainly on websites, with a particular interest in clean design, animation, and creating engaging user experiences that feel alive and intentional rather than static or generic.

While I work across a range of platforms and technologies, a large part of my work involves WordPress websites, custom themes, and ongoing site management.

How long have you been working in web design and development?

I’ve been working professionally in web design and development since 2012.

During that time, I’ve worked both as a freelancer/contractor and as a staff member within digital and creative agencies. This means I understand how projects are handled at an agency level, as well as how to work directly with clients one-on-one.

This mix of experience allows me to bring agency-level thinking and standards to freelance projects, without the overheads or complexity that often come with large teams.

What makes your experience different from someone newer to the industry?

Having worked consistently in the industry since 2012, I’ve seen many trends, tools, and “best practices” come and go. This helps me make practical decisions rather than chasing fads.

I’ve:

Built and maintained websites over many years

Worked with legacy systems and modern stacks

Seen how sites perform long-term, not just at launch

Fixed and improved sites built by others

Worked under agency deadlines and constraints

This experience helps me avoid common mistakes and build websites that are stable, maintainable, and fit for real-world use.

Do you work alone or as part of a team?

I work primarily as an independent freelancer. However, I have experience working as part of larger teams and collaborating with designers, developers, project managers, and content teams.

If a project requires additional skills (for example, large-scale content creation, branding, or specialised integrations), I can either collaborate with others or advise on the best approach.

For most projects, clients deal directly with me, which keeps communication clear and efficient.

What types of clients do you usually work with?

I work with a wide range of clients, including:

Small and medium-sized businesses

Creative professionals

Organisations and non-profits

Agencies needing freelance support

Clients who need ongoing website management

Some clients come to me for a brand-new website, while others need help fixing, improving, or maintaining an existing one.

Where are you based and who do you work with?

I’m based in Ireland, but I work with clients both locally and internationally. Remote work has been a normal part of my workflow for many years, so location is rarely a limitation. 


Skills, Platforms & Technologies
What platforms do you work with?

I work across a range of website platforms and tools, depending on what best suits the project. My strongest and most long-standing experience is with WordPress, but I also work with other modern site builders and CMS platforms.

The main platforms I work with include:

WordPress

Webflow

Wix

Squarespace

Some experience with Framer

AI-assisted and prompt-based builders (where appropriate)

I’m happy to advise on whether a platform is suitable for a specific project, or whether an existing site should be improved rather than rebuilt.

How experienced are you with WordPress?

WordPress is one of my core areas of expertise. I’ve been working with WordPress consistently since around 2012, across many different types of projects.

My WordPress experience includes:

Building custom themes from scratch

Creating block-based themes using Gutenberg

Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

Twig-based templating where appropriate

Custom PHP functions, shortcodes, and plugins

Working directly with the WordPress database when required

WordPress Multisite setups

Multilingual sites using WPML

Performance, security, and long-term maintenance

I’m very comfortable working on both new WordPress builds and existing, sometimes messy, legacy sites.

Do you use WordPress page builders?

Yes. While I often prefer custom themes for flexibility and performance, I regularly work with popular WordPress builders when they are already in place or when they make sense for a client.

This includes experience with:

Elementor

Kadence

WPBakery / Visual Composer

Other common builder-based setups

I can:

Build new pages using these tools

Improve or clean up existing layouts

Fix broken builder content

Advise when a builder is becoming a limitation

Can you work with popular WordPress plugins?

Yes. I’ve worked with a wide range of commonly used WordPress plugins, including:

Contact form plugins (such as Contact Form 7 and similar)

Migration and backup tools (e.g. All-in-One WP Migration)

Security plugins (e.g. Wordfence)

Caching and performance plugins

If a plugin is causing issues, slowing a site down, or conflicting with other parts of the site, I can usually diagnose and resolve the problem.

Do you fix hacked or broken WordPress sites?

Yes. I regularly help clients with:

Cleaning hacked WordPress installations

Removing malicious code

Fixing database issues

Recovering broken sites after failed updates

Restoring sites from backups

Hardening sites to prevent future attacks

Because WordPress is widely used, it’s also widely targeted. I’m very familiar with the common failure points and how to resolve them safely.

Do you work with Webflow, Wix, or Squarespace?

Yes. I have experience working with:

Webflow

Wix

Squarespace

This includes:

Building and editing pages

Improving layouts and content structure

Fixing issues

Advising on platform limitations

Managing ongoing updates and content changes

I’m happy to work within an existing platform if a client doesn’t want or need to move to WordPress.

Do you write JavaScript?

Yes. I use JavaScript regularly to add interactivity and functionality to websites.

This includes:

General DOM manipulation

Interactive components

Calculators and custom logic

Timed and scroll-based animations

Working with Node where needed

Vue.js for more structured front-end behaviour

Some experience with React-based setups (including Gatsby)

Do you do animation and motion work?

Yes — animation is a key part of my work and something I particularly enjoy.

I regularly work with:

GSAP (GreenSock)

Swiper

Lottie animations

JSON-based animations (Lottie, Jitter)

Scroll-based and interaction-driven animations

I focus on animation that enhances usability and storytelling, rather than animation purely for decoration.

Can you help with servers, hosting, and technical setup?

Yes. I handle many technical aspects of website hosting and infrastructure, including:

Website migrations

DNS configuration

.htaccess rules

Cloudflare setup and management

Performance tuning

Fixing hosting-related issues

This is especially useful for clients who don’t want to deal with hosting companies or technical jargon themselves.

Do you handle email configuration?

Yes. I can help with technical email setup, including:

DMARC

SPF

DKIM

General email deliverability issues

This is particularly important for contact forms and transactional emails to ensure messages don’t end up in spam folders.

Do you optimise website performance?

Yes. Performance and optimisation are a key part of my work.

This includes:

Caching configuration (e.g. Breeze, WP Fastest Cache)

Cloudflare caching and optimisation

Image optimisation

Reducing unnecessary scripts and bloat

Improving load times and Core Web Vitals where possible

Do you do graphic design as well?

Yes. I handle graphic design work that supports web and digital projects.

This includes:

Image resizing and compression

SVG creation and optimisation

Vector illustration using Adobe Illustrator

Cartoon characters and custom graphics

Motion graphics and titles using After Effects

Simple animated assets using tools like Animaker

I focus mainly on graphics that are used on websites, social media, and digital marketing, rather than large-scale print campaigns.
